**Loan Default Prediction**

*This repository contains a comprehensive machine learning project aimed at predicting loan defaults using various algorithms. The project includes:*

- **Algorithms Used:** Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, AdaBoost.
- **Data Augmentation:** Implemented SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to handle class imbalance.
- **Data Visualization:** Employed various visualization techniques to explore and understand the dataset.
- **Data Regularization and Normalization:** Applied methods such as Box-Cox transformation for data normalization.

*Project Highlights*

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizations and insights to understand the distribution and relationships within the data.
- **Model Training and Evaluation:** Training multiple models and evaluating their performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Data Augmentation with SMOTE:** Addressing class imbalance to improve model robustness.
- **Feature Engineering:** Regularization and normalization of features using Box-Cox and other techniques.
- **Results and Analysis:** Detailed comparison of model performance and insights on the best approaches for loan default prediction.

*Feel free to explore the notebooks and code to gain insights into the methodologies and techniques used in this project.*
